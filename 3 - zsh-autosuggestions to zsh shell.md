# Adding Zsh Auto-suggestions to Oh My Zsh

This guide will walk you through the steps to add Zsh auto-suggestions to your Oh My Zsh shell.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Oh My Zsh installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions provided in the [official Oh My Zsh repository](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

## Steps

1. Clone the `zsh-autosuggestions` repository to your Oh My Zsh plugins directory. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
   ```

2. Open your `~/.zshrc` file in a text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice, for example:

   ```shell
    nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. Locate the `plugins` section in the `~/.zshrc` file. It should look like this:

   ```shell
    plugins=(git)
   ```

4. Add `zsh-autosuggestions` to the list of plugins, separated by spaces. For example:

   ```shell
   plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)
   ```

5. Save the changes to the `~/.zshrc` file and close the text editor.

6. To activate the new configuration, either restart your terminal or run the following command:
    
   ```shell
    source ~/.zshrc
   ```


7. Zsh auto-suggestions are now enabled in your Oh My Zsh shell. When you start typing a command, you will see suggestions based on your command history. Use the right arrow key or the Tab key to accept a suggestion and complete the command.

8. If you want to see all the supported plugins, please visit the [Oh My Zsh Plugins Directory](URL "https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins")



## Customization

You can customize the behavior and appearance of Zsh auto-suggestions. The configuration options are available in the `~/.zshrc` file under the `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin section. You can modify these options according to your preferences.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully added Zsh auto-suggestions to your Oh My Zsh shell. Enjoy the enhanced command line experience with intelligent suggestions.
