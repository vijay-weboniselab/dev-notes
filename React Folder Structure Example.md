# React Folder Structure


```
src/
|-- assets/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- styles/
|       |-- global.css
|       |-- variables.css
|-- components/
|-- containers/
|-- pages/
|-- services/
|-- utils/
|-- state/
|   |-- actions/
|   |-- reducers/
|   |-- store/
|-- routes/
|-- constants/
|-- helpers/
|-- tests/
|-- App.js
|-- index.js
```

The folder structure is similar to the one mentioned earlier, with some modifications to fit a client-side application:

1. `assets`: This folder contains static assets like images, fonts, and global stylesheets.

2. `components`: This folder contains reusable UI components organized based on their purpose or functionality.

3. `containers`: This folder contains higher-level components that connect to the application's state and combine multiple UI components to form a complete section or page.

4. `pages`: This folder contains top-level components that represent different pages or views in your application.

5. `services`: This folder holds modules responsible for handling API calls, data fetching, and other external service integrations.

6. `utils`: This folder contains utility/helper functions or modules that provide commonly used functionality throughout the application.

7. `state`: This folder contains Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and the store configuration.

8. `routes`: This folder holds files responsible for defining the application's routes and routing configuration.

9. `constants`: This folder contains constant values or enums used throughout the application.

10. `helpers`: This folder contains helper functions or modules that provide specific functionalities related to business logic or data manipulation.

11. `tests`: This folder contains test files for different parts of the application.

12. `App.js`: The root component of your application that serves as the entry point.

13. `index.js`: The entry point of your application, where the ReactDOM.render method is called.

This simplified structure still provides a clear separation of concerns and allows for easy organization and maintainability of your client-side React application. Remember to adapt the structure based on your project's specific requirements and team preferences.
